# MusicForum
A forum for communicating between musicians

#Basic functionality
After registering to the forum, anyone can post questions and participate in discussions. The main goal is to make it easier for musicians, who don't know each other to meet and form bands.

#Backend
After registration each user will get an unique ID and user name. All the information will be saved in a database. An admin can delete user registrations, discussions...
There will be different tags for different instruments, and different categories, in which the discussions will be created.
